Fully managed Model Context Protocol (MCP) bridge for Dexter. The service exposes a curated set of connector tools (wallet resolution, diagnostics, session overrides) over both stdio and HTTPS, reusing the Dexter OAuth infrastructure for user-level access control.

---

## Highlights

- **Production-ready HTTP transport** – OAuth2/OIDC, bearer fallback, SSE streaming, and metadata endpoints compatible with Claude & ChatGPT connectors.
- **Wallet-first toolset** – `resolve_wallet`, `list_my_wallets`, `auth_info`, `set_session_wallet_override`, plus per-session overrides backed by Supabase.
- **Composable tool registry** – drop new bundles into `toolsets/`, enable them via env, CLI flags, or `?tools=` query parameters.
- **Dual-runtime** – stdio entrypoint for local agents & Codex, HTTPS entrypoint for public connectors (proxied at `https://dexter.cash/mcp` and `https://mcp.dexter.cash/mcp`).
- **Supabase-native auth** – validates incoming tokens through Dexter API/Supabase resolver, injects identity headers for downstream tools, and preserves token caching to limit IdP calls.

## Access Tiers

| Label | Who can call | Notes | Examples |
|-------|--------------|-------|----------|
| `guest` | Shared demo bearer (`TOKEN_AI_MCP_TOKEN`), no login required | Read-only research and wallet discovery; no trade execution. | `general/search`, `pumpstream_live_summary`, `markets_fetch_ohlcv`, `wallet/resolve_wallet`, `twitter_search` |
| `member` | Authenticated Supabase session / `dexter_mcp_jwt` | Unlocks personal wallet context and member-only helpers. | `wallet/list_my_wallets`, `wallet/set_session_wallet_override` |
| `pro` | Role-gated (Pro or Super Admin) | Supabase role check gates stream controls. | `stream_get_scene`, `stream_set_scene` |
| `dev` | Super Admins only | Protected experimental surfaces. | `codex_start`, `codex_exec` |
| `internal` | Diagnostic tooling | Not exposed to end users. | `wallet/auth_info` |

Guest and member tiers align with the public marketing funnel: every new Dexter account now ships with a managed wallet, so resolver-backed tools should immediately report `source:"resolver"`; the legacy env fallback (`TOKEN_AI_DEFAULT_WALLET_ADDRESS`) remains for guest-only scenarios.

## Dexter Stack

| Repo | Role |
|------|------|
| [`dexter-api`](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter-api) | Issues realtime tokens, proxies MCP, x402 billing |
| [`dexter-fe`](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter-fe) | Next.js frontend for voice/chat surfaces |
| [`dexter-ops`](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter-ops) | Shared operations scripts, PM2 config, nginx templates |
| [`pumpstreams`](https://github.com/BranchManager69/pumpstreams) | Pump.fun analytics suite (adjacent tooling) |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter-mcp.git
cd dexter-mcp
npm install
cp .env.example .env

# populate .env with required Supabase/OAuth settings

# HTTPS transport (port 3930)
npm start

# or stdio transport for local tools
node server.mjs --tools=wallet
```

Verify the HTTP transport:

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:3930/mcp/health | jq
```

With the public proxy in place you can also query:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN_AI_MCP_TOKEN>" \
     https://mcp.dexter.cash/mcp/health
```

---

## Authentication

| Mode | When to use | How |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **OAuth2 / OIDC** | Claude, ChatGPT, hosted connectors | Set `TOKEN_AI_MCP_OAUTH=true` and supply `TOKEN_AI_OIDC_*` (or Supabase) endpoints. Users sign in via the Dexter IdP; tokens are validated on every session. |
| **Bearer token** | Service-to-service calls, Codex, Cursor | Define `TOKEN_AI_MCP_TOKEN`. Any request presenting the matching `Authorization: Bearer …` header is accepted without hitting the IdP. |
| **Allow-any (demo)** | Local demos only | Set `TOKEN_AI_MCP_OAUTH_ALLOW_ANY=1`. Skips verification—**never enable in production**. |

Metadata endpoints (for connector discovery) are exposed at:

- `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
- `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`
- `/.well-known/openid-configuration`

These routes are proxied on both `dexter.cash` and `mcp.dexter.cash`, so connectors can follow the same issuer regardless of which hostname they use.

## Toolsets

Tool bundles live under `toolsets/<name>/index.mjs` and register themselves through the manifest in `toolsets/index.mjs`.

Currently shipped:

- **general** – Tavily-backed web `search` with `max_results`, depth, and answer summaries plus a `fetch` helper that returns full-page content (snippets, metadata, raw HTML) for realtime research.
- **pumpstream** – `pumpstream_live_summary` view of `https://pump.dexter.cash/api/live`, supporting `pageSize`/`offset`/`page`, search, symbol & mint filters, sort order, status gates, viewer and USD market-cap floors, and optional spotlight data.
- **wallet** – Session-aware helpers (`resolve_wallet`, `list_my_wallets`, `set_session_wallet_override`, `auth_info`) backed by the Supabase resolver with per-session overrides stored in-memory.
- **solana** – Managed Solana trading utilities (`solana_resolve_token`, balance listings, swap preview/execute) proxied through `dexter-api` with entitlement checks.
- **markets** – `markets_fetch_ohlcv` pipes Birdeye v3 pair data, auto-selecting the top-liquidity pair when only a mint is supplied to power price history charts.
- **twitter** – Playwright-powered `twitter_search` against X with multi-query presets, language/reply/media filters, verified-only toggles, and enriched author metadata.
- **stream** – DexterVision scene monitoring (`stream_get_scene`) and switching (`stream_set_scene`) for `pro` access tiers.
- **codex** – Bridges MCP clients to the Codex CLI via `codex_start`, `codex_reply`, and `codex_exec`, supporting optional JSON schemas for structured exec-mode responses.
- **gmgn** – Headless GMGN snapshotter (`gmgn_fetch_token_snapshot`) that clears Cloudflare and returns aggregated stats, trades, and candles for a Solana mint.
- **kolscan** – Kolscan research endpoints (`kolscan_leaderboard`, wallet & token detail, trending tokens, resolver lookups) surfaced through `dexter-api`.

Each tool definition exposes an `_meta` block so downstream clients can group or gate consistently:

```json
{
  "name": "solana_swap_execute",
  "title": "Execute Solana Swap",
  "description": "Execute a SOL-token swap after previewing the expected output.",
  "_meta": {
    "category": "solana.trading",
    "access": "member",
    "tags": ["swap", "execution"]
  }
}
```

- `category` – high-level grouping for UX (e.g. `wallets`, `analytics`, `solana.trading`).
- `access` – current entitlement level (`guest`, `member`, `pro`, `dev`, `internal`).
- `tags` – free-form labels for filtering/badging.

The `/tools` API simply relays this metadata so UIs (including `dexter-fe`) pick it up automatically. Add new values conservatively and document them if third-party clients depend on them.

Selection options:

- **Environment default:** leave `TOKEN_AI_MCP_TOOLSETS` unset to load every registered bundle (general, pumpstream, wallet, solana, markets, twitter, stream, codex, gmgn, kolscan). Set it (comma-separated) to restrict the selection, e.g. `TOKEN_AI_MCP_TOOLSETS=wallet`.
- **CLI/stdio:** `node server.mjs --tools=wallet`.
- **HTTP query:** `POST /mcp?tools=wallet`.
- **Codex:** set `TOKEN_AI_MCP_TOOLSETS` in the env before launching, or add `includeToolsets` when invoking `buildMcpServer` manually.

Public-facing descriptions and metadata belong in the MCP specs; reserve deep orchestration notes, guardrails, and internal guidance for the realtime agent prompts/configs so clients only see the high-level contract.

Legacy Token-AI bundles remain in `legacy-tools/` for reference. They are not registered by default but can be migrated into `toolsets/` as they are modernized.

---

## Development & PM2

Run locally:

```bash
# HTTP transport with auto-reload (e.g. via nodemon)
TOKEN_AI_MCP_PORT=3930 npm start

# Stdio session for quick manual tests
node server.mjs --tools=wallet

# Connect with Codex (bearer token example)
# ~/.codex/config.toml
# [mcp_servers.dexter]
# transport = "http"
# url = "https://mcp.dexter.cash/mcp"
# headers = { Authorization = "Bearer <TOKEN_AI_MCP_TOKEN>" }
```

### Harness Operations

The Playwright harness lives in `../dexter-agents/scripts/runHarness.js` with CLI entry `scripts/dexchat.js` (npm script `dexchat`). Append `--guest` to skip stored auth and exercise the anonymous path; the API leg still rides on the shared demo bearer (`TOKEN_AI_MCP_TOKEN`).

Core commands:

```bash
# Standard run (UI + API with 15s wait)
npm run dexchat -- --prompt "<prompt>" --wait 15000

# Pumpstream harness from this repo (UI + API)
npm run test:pumpstream -- --mode both --prompt "List pump streams"

# Targeted API-only regression run
npm run test:pumpstream -- --mode api --page-size 10 --json --no-artifact
```

Pass harness flags (`--prompt`, `--url`, `--wait`, `--headful`, `--no-artifact`, `--json`, `--mode`, `--page-size`) directly; they forward to the underlying runners. `.env` is auto-loaded so long-lived values such as `HARNESS_COOKIE`, `HARNESS_AUTHORIZATION`, and `HARNESS_MCP_TOKEN` can live there instead of the shell. Artifacts land in `dexter-agents/harness-results/` unless you opt into `--no-artifact`.

Monitor the console for schema warnings (for example, Zod `.optional()` used without `.nullable()`). Treat any warning as a regression that must be cleared before release. Harness artifacts are the source of truth for recent behavioural checks—house longer-form analysis elsewhere so this document stays operational.

For production, PM2 is managed through `dexter-ops/ops/ecosystem.config.cjs`. The config already forwards `TOKEN_AI_MCP_OAUTH=true` and supporting variables; restart via:

```bash
pm2 restart dexter-mcp
pm2 logs dexter-mcp
```

### Session Maintenance Cheatsheet

```
Turnstile + Supabase login (desktop helper)
           │  generates encoded cookie + state.json
           ▼
HARNESS_COOKIE in repos (.env)
           │  injected into Playwright runs
           ▼
Dexchat / pumpstream harness executions
```

| Situation | Run this | Result |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Have a new encoded cookie string | `dexchat refresh` (in `dexter-agents`) | Updates both repos’ `.env` files and rewrites `~/websites/dexter-mcp/state.json` through a local Playwright run. |
| Want a scripted variant | `npm run dexchat:refresh -- --cookie $(cat cookie.txt)` | Same as above without the interactive prompt. |
| Supabase session has expired / cookie immediately fails | `refresh-supabase-session.ps1` (desktop helper) | Spins up SOCKS proxy + Chrome for Turnstile + Supabase login, prints the cookie, and can refresh storage automatically. Afterwards run `dexchat refresh` with the new value. |
| Validate guest behaviour | `npm run dexchat -- --prompt "..." --guest` (or add `--guest` to `npm run pumpstream:harness ...`) | Runs the UI anonymously while the API leg reuses the shared demo bearer (`TOKEN_AI_MCP_TOKEN`). |

Storage state only changes when the harness runs with `--storage` (the refresh helper toggles it automatically). If the cookie helper warns that the pasted value is missing `sb-…-refresh-token`, per-user MCP tokens cannot be minted—re-run the desktop helper to capture a full credential set.

Remember: the desktop helper is rare (weeks between runs). `dexchat refresh` is the lightweight, local option you’ll use most often. Additional command details live in `dexter-agents/scripts/README.md`.

## Architecture Notes

- **`common.mjs`** – builds the MCP server, normalizes Zod schemas, wraps tool registration with logging.
- **`toolsets/`** – declarative manifest of tool bundles plus the wallet toolset implementation.
- **Toolset authoring guide:** see `toolsets/ADDING_TOOLSETS.md` for step-by-step instructions and examples (including the `pumpstream` toolset).
- **`server.mjs`** – stdio entrypoint (used by local agents and Codex); respects `--tools=` flags.
- **`dexter-mcp-stdio-bridge.mjs`** – bridges stdio clients to the hosted OAuth HTTP transport (handy for Codex/Cursor when they only support stdio).
- **`http-server-oauth.mjs`** – HTTPS transport with OAuth/OIDC, session caching, and metadata routes (still contains a Prisma-backed fallback to seed per-session wallet overrides).
- **`legacy-tools/`** – archived Token-AI tools kept for reference during migration.

Supabase interactions flow through Dexter API helpers for consistent auth enforcement. The only remaining Prisma access is the wallet-override seeding noted above; retire it when the resolver exposes a "default wallet" flag.
